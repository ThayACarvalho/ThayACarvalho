- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Thay Carvalho and I'm just begining on this journey
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a portuguese and english bachelor graduate, so books are a BIG thing for me. Movies and tv shows cuz, duh. Football cuz I like testing my heart, and beer while at it, cuz it makes the blow softer. A have a big thing for learning different things, so throw it at me, I'm a fast and passionate learner :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m on the Data Analysis journey, so I'm doing a bit of SQL, a bit of Tableau, dabbing at Python and Power BI, full intention of diving into it soon enough.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me here or at twitter @thaaayc___, in portuguese, english and spanish.
